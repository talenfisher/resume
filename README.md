# Resume Generator

I use this to generate my resume.

```sh
dotnet watch
```

- This will automatically open my resume in a browser, then it can be exported to PDF form from there.
- The content is partially generated based on YAML input files in the Data folder
- This is automatically built and published to [talenfisher.com](https://talenfisher.com) via GitHub Actions
- I used flexbox styling so it should look good on mobile too
